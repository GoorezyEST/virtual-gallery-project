        This project was made with the aim of showing some of my skills in terms
        of design and handling of CSS. It was done in less than two hours and
        used well-known techniques such as a constantly moving edge taking
        advantage of the pseudo elements.

      <p class="project__description__text">
        The only technology used in this project, besides HTML, was CSS, more
        specifically the SASS preprocessor.
